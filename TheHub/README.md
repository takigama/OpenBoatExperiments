# The hub....

Its goal will really be to get data from sensors, receive MQTT data, be an endpoint that can provide mqtt, nmea and signalK endpoints that things like opencpn can talk to.

On My boat this is likely to be a nanopi which may or maynot also have a linux dekstop with a monitor running opencpn. I hoping to have a monitor near the entry way on a swivel that'll be able to swing around to be visible form the helm... maybe...

I want an option that can be an ais receiver as well

This machine will also process camera footage, which is also why im keen on the nanopi's because they run the rockwell chips that have on board NPU's (think cameras with AI image recog)
