# Device UPS

This device will be based on the MCP73871 (single lithium charge and power pass controller)

This device will take from 10 to 48v input, have a single 18650 battery, and be able to output 8v

The purpose of the device is to provide backup power to any of the sensors or screens used in the setup

LM5164 for the buck side

Would be cool if i can insert a mini solar panel in here somewhere
