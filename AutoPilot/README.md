# Autopilot...

This is a placeholder for an opensource autopilot. I know there are few that exist already (like fenix), but I have an alterive idea that should work equally well on both tillers and wheels and should be significantly quieter....

The idea though is to be able to track a vector based on multiple factors and ultimately get the AP to do a more intelligent job than the average autopilot. i.e. dont just hold a heading, trying and keep me on a track, but more importantly minimise sound. Hopefully trying to determine the AP's movements based on a final intent we should be able to minimise the number of movements the AP needs to make. 

Much like the speed from the gps with the aditional sensors, we should be able to get the AP to intelligently hold the rudder in one single direction (rather than making constant changes) based on the rolling and acceleration of the vesel in different directions.

I'll have some graphics to explain what that means later.
